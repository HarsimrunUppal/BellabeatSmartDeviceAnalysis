Bellabeat Smart Device analysis 


I first performed a few queries in Google BigQuery to check the consistency in the number of participants in each table for the 
Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset. After analyzing this dataset in a visualization, I will provide suggestions for the methods Bellabeat can use to 
improve the marketing strategy of their smart devices. 

SELECT distinct Id FROM `weight_info.Weight`
--8 out of the 30 people in this dataset logged in their weight/BMI info

SELECT distinct Id FROM `sleepday_info.sleep`
--24 people submitted results for their sleep

SELECT distinct Id FROM `calories_info.calories`
--33 people submitted results for their calories

SELECT distinct Id FROM `steps_info.steps`
--33 people submitted results for their steps

SELECT distinct Id FROM `daily_activities_info.activities`
--33 people submitted results for their daily activities

--After performing these queries, it is revealed that there are a maximum of 33 people that submitted their results for 
some of the tables, but the description of the dataset states there are up to 30 people who were a part of this study. 
This reveals an inconsistency in reporting the correct number of individuals who consented to the data being used for the study. 
Also, the lack of participants in the Sleep and Weight tables will make the data biased due to the small sample size. 

--Let’s look at the relationship of activity, sleep time, and weight/BMI

--Relationship between weight_log_info and daily calories tables. 
I did an inner join function in SQL to compare the BMI of each person to the calories burned on the activity date. 
The tables were joined on the participant's Id number. 

Select distinct w.Id, BMI, c.Calories, c.ActivityDay
from `weight_info.Weight` as w
inner join `calories_info.calories` as c 
on w.Id = c.Id

--Relationship between the calories burned and total steps on an activity day. There are two joins 
in this query for the Id number of the participants and their Activity date. 
Select c.Calories, ds.Step_Total, c.ActivityDay
from `calories_info.calories` as c
join `steps_info.steps` as ds
on c.Id = ds.Id
and c.ActivityDay = ds.Activity_Day

--Now, let’s look at how the Activity Level compares to the BMI, Sleep Time, and Daily Calorie Intake of the individuals in this study. 

--Activity vs BMI 
Select weight.Id, ActivityDate, VeryActiveMinutes,TotalDistance,SedentaryMinutes, BMI, TotalSteps from `daily_activities_info.activities` as activity
inner join `weight_info.Weight` as weight
on activity.Id = weight.Id
and activity.activitydate = weight.Date
 
--Activity vs Sleep Time 
Select ActivityDate,VeryActiveMinutes,TotalDistance,SedentaryMinutes,TotalSteps, SleepDay, TotalMinutesAsleep
from `daily_activities_info.activities` as activity
inner join `sleepday_info.sleep`as sleep
on activity.Id = sleep.Id
and activity.ActivityDate = sleep.SleepDay

--Activity vs Daily Calorie Intake 
Select activity.Id,ActivityDate,VeryActiveMinutes,TotalDistance,SedentaryMinutes,TotalSteps,Calories
from `daily_activities_info.activities` as activity
inner join `calories_info.calories` as calories
on activity.Id = calories.Id
and activity.ActivityDate = calories.ActivityDay
